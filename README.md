pytravis
========

Run your travis-ci scripts locally to preview their results. This doesn't do any of the installation or matrix stuff (for the most part).

Installation
------------

To install, use the setup.py

    python setup.py install

Basic Use
---------

Run your scripts:

    pytravis

Or explicitly:

    pytravis run

You can also use this to run your installer, but probably that will be trouble

    pytravis install
